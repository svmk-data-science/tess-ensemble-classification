# Rare Event Detection Using Ensemble Machine Learning on Large-Scale Public Data
## Overview

Developed an end-to-end machine learning pipeline to detect rare signals within large, noisy, and highly imbalanced datasets using publicly available data from NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) mission.

Although developed in an astrophysics context, this project addresses a core data science challenge common across finance, healthcare, cybersecurity, and risk modelling: accurately identifying rare but high-value events in complex data environments.

## Problem Statement

Detecting exoplanets from telescope observations is analogous to a real-world rare-event detection problem:
- Highly imbalanced class (few positives among many many negatives)
- Noisy and imperfect measurements
- False negatives are costly (missing a true signal)
- Requires careful threshold optimisation beyond default probabilities

This mirrors challenges in:
- Fraud Detection
- Medical Diagnosis
- Cybersecurity anomaly detection
- Risk Modelling
