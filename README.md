# Rare Event Detection Using Ensemble Machine Learning on Large-Scale Public Data
Overview

Developed an end-to-end machine learning pipeline to detect rare signals within large, noisy, and highly imbalanced datasets using publicly available data from NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) mission.

Although developed in an astrophysics context, this project addresses a core data science challenge common across finance, healthcare, cybersecurity, and risk modelling: accurately identifying rare but high-value events in complex data environments.
